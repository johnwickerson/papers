\section{Application: Generic Properties (\Q5, \Q2)}
In this section we use our tool to validate two generic properties of
memory models: SC-DRF and multi-copy atomicity.



\subsection{Seeking SC-DRF Violations (\Q5)}
\label{sec:scdrf}

This section reports on our use of Alloy to search for violations of
the SC-DRF guarantee in an early draft of the C11 MCM. The
SC-DRF guarantee, in the C11 context, is that if a program is
race-free and involves no atomic operations that are not
"memory\_order\_seq\_cst", then it has only SC semantics.

We search for an execution that satisfies
\[
\stack{\exists X\in\Exec\ldotp \field{X}{A} \subseteq \field{X}{sc}
\wedge {}\\{} \quad X\in dead_{\mm{C11}}
\cap consistent_{\mm{C11-Draft}} - consistent_{\mm{SC}}.}
\]
That is: we seek an execution that is dead (so that its corresponding
litmus test is race-free), uses only SC atomics, and is consistent
under the (draft) C11 MCM but inconsistent under \mm{SC}. The
\mm{SC} MCM is characterised by
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
consistent_{\mm{SC}} &\eqdef& acyclic(rf \cup co \cup fr \cup sb) \\
racefree_{\mm{SC}} &\eqdef& true
\end{eqnarray*}
while the \mm{C11-Draft} MCM has the same axioms as those listed
by Batty et al.~\cite{batty+16}, minus the `S4' axiom that was added
by Batty et al.~\cite{batty+11} to fix exactly this issue.

The execution found by Alloy
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{tikzpicture}[inner sep=1pt, baseline=(a.base)]
\node (a) at (0,0.8) {$\evW{\mosc}{"x"}{1}$};
\node (b) at (0,0) {$\evW{\mosc}{"y"}{1}$};
\node (c) at (1.8,0.8) {$\evW{\mosc}{"y"}{2}$};
\node (d) at (1.8,0) {$\evR{\mosc}{"x"}{0}$};
\draw[edgemo, shift right=0.5mm, inner sep=1mm] (b) to [auto, swap, pos=0.3] node {$co$} (c);
\draw[edgesb, shift right=0.5mm, inner sep=1mm] (a) to [auto, swap] node {$sb$} (b);
\draw[edgesb, shift right=0.5mm, inner sep=1mm] (c) to [auto, swap] node {$sb$} (d);
\draw[edgeS, shift left=0.5mm, inner sep=1mm] (a) to [auto] node {$S$} (b);
\draw[edgeS, shift left=0.5mm, inner sep=1mm] (b) to [auto, pos=0.7] node {$S$} (c);
\draw[edgeS, shift left=0.5mm, inner sep=1mm] (c) to [auto] node {$S$} (d);
\node[sthd, fit=(a)(b)] {};
\node[sthd, fit=(c)(d)] {};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}
%
is similar that reported by Batty et al.~\cite{batty+11}. It is not SC
because the read of "x" observes a stale value, but it is consistent
under \mm{C11-Draft} because \JWComment{need to finish this sentence
somehow!}.
