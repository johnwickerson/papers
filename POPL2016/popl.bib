  abstract =      {Concurrency is pervasive and perplexing, particularly
                   on graphics processing units (GPUs). Current
                   specifications of languages and hardware are
                   inconclusive; thus programmers often rely on folklore
                   assumptions when writing software. To remedy this
                   state of affairs, we conducted a large empirical
                   study of the concurrent behaviour of deployed GPUs.
                   Armed with litmus tests (i.e. short concurrent
                   programs), we questioned the assumptions in
                   programming guides and vendor documentation about the
                   guarantees provided by hardware. We developed a tool
                   to generate thousands of litmus tests and run them
                   under stressful workloads. We observed a litany of
                   previously elusive weak behaviours, and exposed
                   folklore beliefs about GPU programming---often
                   supported by official tutorials---as false. As a way
                   forward, we propose a model of Nvidia GPU hardware,
                   which correctly models every behaviour witnessed in
                   our experiments. The model is a variant of SPARC
                   Relaxed Memory Order (RMO), structured following the
                   GPU concurrency hierarchy.},

                   published their design for ``remote-scope
                   promotion''. This is a proposal that extends OpenCL
                   with the ability to combine two popular heterogeneous
                   programming features: work-stealing and memory
                   scopes. We have worked with the AMD team to formalise
                   their design, both at the level of the OpenCL memory
                   model, and at the level of the underlying
                   implementation in hardware. We uncovered and fixed
                   several significant bugs in their implementation
                   (including a violation of message-passing), and we
                   now propose an alternative implementation that is
                   definitely simpler and probably more efficient. Our
                   work demonstrates the value of applying formal
                   methods early in the design process.},
